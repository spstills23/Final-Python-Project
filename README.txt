Python/SQL Class Project 
		- Sean Stills

-For this project I asked the question of:
	"Does a college basketball team perform better when their mascot is Human or Non-Human in the NCAA basketball Tournament?"

-This report will take the results from every NCAA Tournamnet game since the 1985 season and compare whether teams with Non-Human or Human mascots win more.

-I first came across the data I needed on Kaggle. The link to the original is located here https://www.kaggle.com/ncaa/ncaa-basketball. 
This provided me with all the data that I needed from 1985 on. 
There is really no background to this question that I am trying to answer other than the simple fact that I am curious of what the outome would be but I have a general hypothesis of what the end results will show.
Within the report I will build dataframes and SQL databases to map out and show Team Total Wins,Team Wins merged with Mascots Names and finally catagorizing them into human and non-humans.
We will count data sets to tally totals, graph with bar graphs and histograms as well as use some statistics and pie charts to see the results of our above questions.

-There should be no neeed for special directions in running the code in jupyter notebooks. All files and information should be apart of the project folder.

For references to key words in headers here is a glossary of terms:

Glossary:

Team ID: The given reference number for each specific university.
market: The city or region that the university resides in.
name: The team nickname or common name such as the Kentucky "Wildcats".
home team: In the NCAA tournament, usually means the team with the higher seed.
away team: See the opposite of the home team.
seed: The rankings of each school. This number classifies the game matchups.
conference: a group of teams usually 10 to 12 in which share a geographical region and thus play regular season games with each other.
power 5: A collection of the top 5 conferences in terms of notoriety, size, and quality of teams, ex. SEC, PAC12, BIG10, BIG12, ACC.
